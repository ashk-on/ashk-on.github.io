I'm a postdoctoral researcher in machine learning and computer vision working with [Philip Torr](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=kPxa2w0AAAAJ&hl=en) at the University of Oxford. I am driven by my curiosity about understanding how intelligence emerges in neural networks through learning. Thus my PhD research was focused on how to interpret neural networks, and I was lucky to have this experience at the Technical University of Munich (TUM). I was inspired throughout my entire PhD journey by my supervisor, [Nassir Navab](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=kzoVUPYAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao). I am very thankful to [Bernt Schiele](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=z76PBfYAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) for reviewing my PhD research and inspiring me with his ideas. These days I am following the same vision in the context of vision-language foundation models.

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
