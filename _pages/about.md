Hi there! I am a doctoral candidate at the Technical University of Munich ([TUM](https://www.cs.cit.tum.de/camp/members/ashkan-khakzar/)), where I'm focusing on the exciting field of explainable machine learning. Over the course of my academic journey, I've had the opportunity to work on a wide range of fascinating topics in computer vision and medical imaging. My PhD supervisor is [Prof. Navab](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=kzoVUPYAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) (TUM). As an affiliate researcher at the Munich Center for Machine Learning ([MCML](https://mcml.ai/publications/)), I'm fortunate to be part of a vibrant community of researchers and scholars exploring the frontiers of artificial intelligence.

<!-- When I'm not working on research, I love exploring the great outdoors. Hiking and immersing myself in nature are some of my favorite pastimes. In my free time, I'm an avid reader and enjoy delving into books and lectures on computer science, philosophy, and the history of science. -->


<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
